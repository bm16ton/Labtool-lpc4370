 * functionallity by remapping the UARTPutChar() function into ITM_SendChar()

 * option makes it possible to completely remove all printouts which saves
 * ROM and some RAM.

 * There are some limitations to what the hardware can and can't do. By enabling
 * this option those checks are made and if the hardware is likely to be
 * overpowered an error code is returned to the client instead of applying
 * the configuration. By disabling this option you are likely to get errors
 * in the client due to disconnected hardware. This occurs because the MCU is
 * so busy that there is no time to maintain the USB connection.
 *
 * Note: This options should ALWAYS be enabled in released software!
